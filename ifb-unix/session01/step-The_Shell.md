The Shell is a software that can handle multiple Unix instructions and has become higly used by the bioinformatics community. 
Indeed, the multiple steps of a bioinformatics analysis usually need to be stored for traceability, reproducibility or automation purposes. 
With a Shell you can perform highly complex tasks by accessing either locally or distantly shared resources (e.g. files, databases, remote computing clusters...).
These tasks are also easy to share with collaborators.

To access these powerful features, you need to learn a new way of thinking and a new language.
