Welcome!

During this course, you will discover the Unix system and run some Bash commands.

The left panel contains the explanations and guides to run Unix commands. Use the right panel to type the command examples and experiment as you wish.

During the course, some instructions will be explained. They will be written like `this` and must be copied in the right window. Their text can be modified if you like, but in order to answer questions or quizz, we recommend copying and pasting the proposed instructions exactly as they are writen.
