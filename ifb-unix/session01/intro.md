Welcome!

During this course, you will discover the Unix system and you run some Bash commands.

The left panel contains the explanations and guides to run Unix commands. Use the right panel to type the command examples and experiment as you wishe.

During the course, some bash instructions will be explained. They will be written like `this` and must be copied in the right window. Their text or value can be modified if you wish, but in order to answer questions or quizzes, we advise you to copy the proposed instructions exactly as they are.
