Using a Bash shell, you will be abble to write and execute Unix commands. 
A Unix command is made of three distinct parts: a command name, options and arguments.

The space character is mandatory to separate all these elements. 
You may now understand why a space in a file or a directory name is a very bad idea in a Unix environment.

Be very careful while writing your Unix commands: lowercases and uppercases are not the same! 
Unix commands are usually in lowercase.
