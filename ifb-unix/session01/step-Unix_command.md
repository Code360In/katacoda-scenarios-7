Using a Bash shell, you will be abble to write and execute Unix commands. 
A Unix command is made of distinct parts: a **command name** and if needed, **options** and **arguments**.

The space character is mandatory to separate all these elements. 
You may now understand why a space in a file or a directory name is a very bad idea in an Unix environment.

Be very careful while writing your Unix commands: lowercases and uppercases are not the same! 
Unix commands are usually in lowercase.

Now, type the following command in your terminal and press <kbd>enter</kbd> to valid it:
```bash
date
`

>>Are your Bash shell ok with the current date?<<
(*) yes
( ) no
