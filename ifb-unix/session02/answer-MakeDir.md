Use the _mkdir_ command and the absolute path to create the new directory:

```bash
mkdir /shared/projects/facts/new_dir
```
Copy the file _~/test/first_file.txt_ to the new directory: 
```bash
cp ~/test/first_file.txt /shared/projects/facts/new_dir/1st_file.txt
```
Last, list the content of the new directory with the _ls_ command:

```bash
ls /shared/projects/facts/new_dir
```
