The `mkdir` command (**m**a**k**e **dir**rectory) create a new repository:

`mkdir path_to_A_New_Directory`

The `rmdir` (**r**e**m**ove**dir**ectory) command is used to delete an empty directory:

`rmdir path_to_An_Empty_Directory`

The `rm` command is used to suppress files (for example to empty a directory):

`rm path_to_a_file_to_suppress` 

The `mv` (**m**o**v**e) command takes 2 names as parameter: 

`mv source destination`

It renames the **source** in **destination** and it works for a couple of file names or a couple of directory paths.

>>The move command differs from the remove command by (select the right proposals):<<
[ ] move applies to files or folders while remove applies to folders only
[ ] move requires 2 paths while remove requires only one path
[ ] move removes files or folders when the destination path already exists
