The commands of the previous chapter allowed you to move around in the Unix file system and to access files. 
This chapter will show you how to work with the data into those files. 
The tools weâ€™ll use are fairly simple, but are solid building blocks.

First thing, go to the `data` repository with the `cd` command seen n the previous session:

`cd data`

## Step1:  How to look at the content of files ?

###  *cat*

A first command allowing to view the content of a file is `cat`:

`cat gnagnagna.fasta`

This command will print the whole content of the _gnagnagna.fasta_ file to the screen.


Print the content of the _belebele.fasta_ file. 

>> What are the last three nucleotides of the belebele.fasta file ? <<
(*) cag
( ) ele
( ) atc
( ) bel
