### *head*

You might sometimes want to check just the beginning of a file.
The `head` command is made for that:

```bash
head belebele.bed
```

By default, that command will show you the first 10 lines of a file. 

You can modulate the number of lines shown with the option _-n_:

```
head -n 15 belebele.bed
``` 

will show you the first 15 lines.
